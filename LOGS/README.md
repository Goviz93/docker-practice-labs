# 🧪 Executing Bash Scripts in Docker to Validate Logs

> A practice focused on executing Bash scripts inside Docker containers and validating services through container logs.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to use Docker to run a Bash script during container startup and validate service behavior using `docker logs`.

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Docker
- Apache2
- Bash
- Unzip

---

## 📂 Files & Structure

```bash
.
├── Dockerfile
├── cmd.sh
```

---

## 📝 Steps Performed

1. Created a `Dockerfile` using ARGs for username and package.
2. Installed Apache and unzip.
3. Set labels and declared environment variables.
4. Downloaded and extracted remote HTML content into `/var/www/html`.
5. Added a new user and adjusted directory permissions.
6. Switched temporarily to the new user and cleaned up files.
7. Copied a custom `cmd.sh` script into the container and gave it execute permissions.
8. Set the CMD to run the script so its output appears in `docker logs`.

## 💡 Useful Commands

```bash
docker build -t apache_with_code:v7 . --build-arg user=gonzalo --build-arg library=apache2
docker run -d --name apache -p 9090:80 apache_with_code:v7
docker logs apache
docker stop apache
docker start apache
```

---

## ✅ Expected Result

By running `docker logs apache`, you should see the output generated by the `cmd.sh` script, confirming that it executed correctly within the container.
